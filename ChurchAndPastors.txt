Church History:
Thiruverkadu, a well-known pilgrimage center for the people of Chennai, is a rapidly growing village located 15 km from the city. No matter which direction you turn, you will find beautiful temples, both large and small. However, churches are a rare sight in this area. With a deep burden for this region, Rev. D. Mohan, Chief Pastor of New Life A.G. Church and General Superintendent of the All India Assemblies of God, sent Pr. N. Johnson to pioneer a church in Thiruverkadu in October 1998.

The task was anything but easy. With nearly 99% of the population being Hindus, most of whom were slum dwellers bound by sin, sickness, and spiritual oppression, opposition was inevitable. The first Sunday service was held in a rented house on November 7, 1998, with just two people in attendance.
 
Pr. Johnson faced intense resistance from the neighborhood, and some even threatened to take his life. Yet, amid these trials and tribulations, God began to move. Within a year, the small house church could no longer accommodate the growing congregation, which had increased to about 30 people. Finding a new place for worship became a challenge, as many doors were closed to Christians. However, after much prayer and effort, the church moved to a rented thatched shed in the year 2000. Within two years, the congregation grew to around 120 members by the grace of God. 

In 2003, God enabled FLAG to purchase a piece of land and build a hall with a light roof Shed. The congregation doubled once again, leading to the introduction of two services. However, on December 23, 2005, the building was demolished due to a government scheme, and the church’s land was merged with the river. Yet, the Lord remained faithful. Miraculously, He provided the means to purchase new land, and on May 8, 2008, the present church building was dedicated. Since then, the congregation has continued to grow, and a third service was added. Today, the church actively serves Thiruverkadu and its surrounding areas. By God's grace, 12 branch churches and two house churches are now functioning, and seven missionaries are supported financially every month. Currently, the church has around 1,000 active members. Indeed, God is faithful!

Pastor details:
Our Senior Pastor – Rev. N. Johnson
 
Rev. N. Johnson’s life is a powerful testimony of God’s grace and transformation. Born and raised in a Hindu family in a small village in India, young Johnson had an intense longing to see and know God—even at the age of 13. He spent hours in a local library, reading Hindu legends in search of divine truth. However, the more he read, the more he realized that these stories were mere myths, leading him to question his beliefs.
 
Disillusioned, he turned to atheism and drifted into a life of sin. Yet, despite his attempts to find satisfaction, his heart remained empty, and his mind was tormented by fear of the future. It was during this season of searching that a family friend invited him to a Christmas service in a nearby town. Though hesitant, Johnson attended—and that decision changed his life forever. That day, the Lord touched him, transformed his heart, and filled him with His peace. On September 3, 1989, Johnson accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior and was baptized.
 
He later began working as a machine operator at a granite company. One evening, as he was praying, he had a divine encounter. The Lord spoke to him, saying, "You have only one life, and it passes away like a tale that is told. Spend it in My service, and I will give you an eternal crown." Overwhelmed by God’s call, Johnson surrendered his life to ministry, resigning from his job to pursue theological studies. In 1994, he joined Southern Asia Bible College in Bangalore and, in 1997, graduated with a Bachelor of Theology degree. He then served under Rev. Jaipal (Living Gospel Fellowship, Bangalore) and Rev. John Jebaraj (Praise Assembly, Chennai), gaining valuable ministry experience.
 
In 1998, Johnson married Jemimah, and soon after, they moved to Thiruverkadu to pioneer a church. Through their unwavering faith and commitment, God blessed their ministry abundantly. Their family also grew, with the birth of their son, Jerry Jemson, and daughter, Jerusha Pearlin.
 
Today, Rev. N. Johnson holds a Master’s in Theology and is pursuing his Doctorate. God is using him mightily, and his life and ministry continue to impact and bless countless people in Thiruverkadu and beyond. His story stands as a testament to the faithfulness of God and the power of a life fully surrendered to His call.
