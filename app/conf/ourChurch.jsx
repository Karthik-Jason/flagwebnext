    "Thiruverkadu, a well-known pilgrimage center for the people of Chennai, is a rapidly growing village located 15 km from the city. No matter which direction you turn, you will find beautiful temples, both large and small. However, churches are a rare sight in this area. With a deep burden for this region, Rev. D. Mohan, Chief Pastor of New Life A.G. Church and General Superintendent of the All India Assemblies of God, sent Pr. N. Johnson to pioneer a church in Thiruverkadu in October 1998.",
    "The task was anything but easy. With nearly 99% of the population being Hindus, most of whom were slum dwellers bound by sin, sickness, and spiritual oppression, opposition was inevitable. The first Sunday service was held in a rented house on November 7, 1998, with just two people in attendance.",
    "Pr. Johnson faced intense resistance from the neighborhood, and some even threatened to take his life. Yet, amid these trials and tribulations, God began to move. Within a year, the small house church could no longer accommodate the growing congregation, which had increased to about 30 people. Finding a new place for worship became a challenge, as many doors were closed to Christians. However, after much prayer and effort, the church moved to a rented thatched shed in the year 2000. Within two years, the congregation grew to around 120 members by the grace of God.",
    "In 2003, God enabled FLAG to purchase a piece of land and build a hall with a light roof Shed. The congregation doubled once again, leading to the introduction of two services. However, on December 23, 2005, the building was demolished due to a government scheme, and the churchâ€™s land was merged with the river. Yet, the Lord remained faithful. Miraculously, He provided the means to purchase new land, and on May 8, 2008, the present church building was dedicated. Since then, the congregation has continued to grow, and a third service was added. Today, the church actively serves Thiruverkadu and its surrounding areas. By God's grace, 12 branch churches and two house churches are now functioning, and seven missionaries are supported financially every month. Currently, the church has around 1,000 active members. Indeed, God is faithful!"
